# Assignment02
This is a website for DMS290 assignment...

I forked this project off of Houyao Li.

I made the following changes...
1.Updated the title and moved the image
  a. The title was just a big word and nothing else. I added a font to the title, made the font bigger and also moving the background logo next to it.
  This makes it much more clear that the user can click the logo/title at any time to go back to the home screen.
2.Changed the colors of the hover functionality
  a. The hover functionality blended in with the rest of the website. It was also this weird color that I felt didn't match the feel of the city. I changed it to red which makes it really pop and makes it clear to the user they are hovering over something.
3.Changed background
  a. With the previous background image being moved to the title/logo, I looked up a new image to be used as the background. I chose this image because its colors were very soft
  and not very distracting to the users eyes. Just as a safeguard I added a slightly transparent white background behind the content.
4.Updated Navigation
  a. Changed the design of the navigation to match the theme of the website while also being much more obivous they are buttons that take you to other parts of the website.
  b. Made the buttons bigger for easier use
5.Added a home button in navigation
  a. In case the user is not familiar with clicking the logo to go home, they can just click the home button in navigation.
  b. Better at showing the user there is four pages to look at.
6.Added red accent colors
  a. The red really draws the eyes of the user to let them know what to look at.
7.Got rid of the javascript
  a.The website I originally downloaded seemed to be bugged as there was random times it would be stuck loading.
  b.Getting rid of the javascript fixed this.
8.Added a 'is-current' color to navigation
  a.To make up for the javascript error, I went and changed the color of the navigation link of the current page. This tells the user where they are in the site and where they can go.
9.Overall change in design
10.Minor edits and changes for looks/function.
